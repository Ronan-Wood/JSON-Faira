### Updated Json Files for Faira

## Goal:
- Improve the quiering abilty and interaction with Faria by improving the descriptions to make it easier for Faira to understand.

## Why:
 - Detailed Descriptions: Clear descriptions of each column help the chatbot understand the context and purpose of each data field. This makes it easier for the chatbot to provide accurate and relevant responses to user queries.
 - Defined Relationships: The inclusion of the foreign key and relational details ensures that the chatbot can accurately link related records (e.g., linking training entries to specific members).
 - Status and Tracking Information: Providing information about the status and update tracking helps the chatbot to manage and report on the progress and changes in training records more effectively.
 - Specific Dates: Including precise details about dates (completion and expiration) allows the chatbot to give accurate timelines and reminders.
